Chef has a string S consisting of lowercase English characters. Chef defined functions left shift L(X) and right shift R(X) as follows.

L(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string X one step towards left and moving the first character to the end.
R(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string X one step towards the right and moving the last character to the beginning.
For example, L("abcd") = "bcda" and R("abcd") = "dabc"

Chef wants to find out whether there exists a string V of the same length as S such that both L(V)=S and R(V)=S holds.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string S.
Output:
For each test case, If there exists a valid string V, print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (without the quotes).

Constraints
1=T=100
1=|S|=106
S contains all lower case English alphabets.
It's guaranteed that the total length of the strings in one test file doesn't exceed 106

Sample Input:

Sample Output:
