After performing a lot of experiments at the SEGP and EEDC Lab, you need a break. You see your roommate stuck at a math problem. He asks for your help and says he will give you party at the NC if you solve this problem for him.

The problem is:

Initially you are given the number 0. After each day the numberdoubles itself. At any day, you can add the number 1 any number of times during the day.

You are given a number N and you need to tell the minimum number of times you have to add 1 to get N at any point of time.

Since you are very hungry, solve this problem for him to get something to eat for free.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines contain the integer N.

Constraints

0 < T < 101 0 < N <= 10^9

Output Format

For every test case print the required output.

For 8, you need to add 1 only once at the starting. It will double to 2, then to 4, then to 8.
For 5, you need to add 1 at the beginning, it will double to 2, then to 4, then you will have to add 1 again to make it 5. So, answer is 2.
